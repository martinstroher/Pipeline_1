It is particularly significant in the Brazilian Pre-Salt for its association with the deposition of major carbonate reservoir rocks.",UNIDADE_CRONO
calcarenites,"Calcarenites are a type of limestone that is characterized by a clastic texture and composed predominantly of sand-sized (0.0625 to 2 mm) carbonate grains, such as bioclasts, ooids, peloids, or intraclasts.",ROCHA
siltite,"A siltite is a sedimentary rock that is primarily composed of silt-sized particles, ranging from 0.004 to 0.0625 mm in diameter. It is a clastic rock, typically formed from the accumulation and lithification of detrital grains such as quartz, feldspar, and clay minerals, and represents a finer-grained equivalent of sandstone.",ROCHA
bioclast,"A bioclast is a fragment that is derived from the skeletal or shell material of an organism, often fossilized, and serves as a constituent grain in sedimentary rocks, particularly carbonates.",FOSSEIS
dolostone,"Dolostone is a sedimentary carbonate rock that is predominantly composed of the mineral dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2), typically containing more than 50% dolomite by weight.",ROCHA
siltstone,"Siltstone is a clastic sedimentary rock that is predominantly composed of silt-sized particles, which are finer than sand but coarser than clay.",ROCHA
bioclasts,Bioclasts are skeletal fragments that are derived from the remains of organisms and are preserved as fossil components within sedimentary rocks.,FOSSEIS
calcarenite,A calcarenite is a limestone that is primarily composed of sand-sized (0.0625 to 2 mm) carbonate grains.,ROCHA
ripples,"A ripple is a sedimentary bedform that is a small-scale undulation of the sediment surface, typically characterized by a wavelength of centimeters to decimeters and formed by the interaction of a fluid (water or wind) with unconsolidated sediment.",ESTRUTURA_FISICA
Barra Velha Formation,"A Barra Velha Formation Field is an oil and gas field that extracts hydrocarbons primarily from the Barra Velha Formation, a significant lacustrine carbonate reservoir unit within the Brazilian Pre-Salt play.",CAMPO
coquinas,"A coquina is a type of bioclastic sedimentary rock that is predominantly composed of whole or fragmented shells of bivalve mollusks, often with a minor matrix. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these rocks are typically lacustrine in origin and constitute significant carbonate reservoirs.",ROCHA
Campos de Badejo,"Campos de Badejo is an oil and gas field that is situated in the Campos Basin, offshore Brazil, and primarily produces hydrocarbons from turbiditic sandstone reservoirs of the Oligocene Carapebus Formation.",CAMPO
Mangakahia,"Mangakahia is a genus of foraminifera that is characterized by a distinctive calcareous test morphology. This microfossil is commonly found in marine sedimentary rocks and is utilized in biostratigraphic correlation and paleoenvironmental reconstruction, particularly in petroleum exploration.",FOSSEIS
ostracod,"An ostracod is a biomineralized microfossil that is primarily composed of calcium carbonate, forming the bivalved carapace of a small aquatic crustacean, and is a common constituent of carbonate rocks.",MINERAIS
spherulite stone,"A spherulite stone is a rock that is characterized by the presence of spherulites, which are spherical to subspherical aggregates of radially arranged acicular crystals, typically composed of carbonate minerals like aragonite or calcite. These structures commonly form during early diagenesis or direct precipitation in lacustrine or shallow marine environments.",ROCHA
sb-1,"sb-1 is an exploratory well that was drilled in the Santos Basin, offshore Brazil, and is recognized as one of the pioneering wells that confirmed the presence of significant pre-salt carbonate reservoirs, contributing to the discovery of the Tupi (Lula) field.",POÇO
Oxfordian,"Oxfordian is a chronostratigraphic unit that constitutes a stage within the Late Jurassic epoch, spanning from approximately 163.5 to 157.3 million years ago.",UNIDADE_CRONO
