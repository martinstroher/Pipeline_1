Santos Namibe,"The Santos Namibe Basin is a trans-Atlantic sedimentary basin system that formed during the Mesozoic breakup of Gondwana, linking the Santos Basin on the Brazilian margin with the Namibe Basin on the Angolan margin, and is characterized by a shared geological evolution including extensive pre-salt carbonate and post-salt clastic petroleum systems.",BACIA
Cenozoic,"The Cenozoic is a geological era that spans from 66 million years ago to the present day, following the Mesozoic Era, and is characterized by the diversification of mammals, birds, and flowering plants, and the rise of humans.",UNIDADE_CRONO
ooliths,"Ooliths are a preserved biogenic sedimentary component that consists of concentric layers of calcium carbonate precipitated around a nucleus, often formed in agitated shallow-water environments and indicative of past microbial activity.",FOSSEIS
oncoid,"An oncoid is a type of microbialite that consists of a concentrically laminated, generally spheroidal to irregular accretionary structure formed by the growth of microbial communities around a nucleus. Unlike stromatolites, oncoids typically lack internal organization and form in agitated, shallow-water carbonate settings, often serving as important components of carbonate reservoirs like those in the Brazilian Pre-Salt.",FOSSEIS
calcirudite,"A calcirudite is a carbonate rock that contains at least 25% of its framework grains larger than 2 mm in diameter, typically composed of carbonate clasts, shells, or ooids.",MINERAIS
TOC,"TOC is a lithological unit that is characterized by a high content of Total Organic Carbon, representing the preserved organic matter capable of generating hydrocarbons.",UNIDADE_LITO
carboniferous,"The Carboniferous is a chronostratigraphic unit that represents a major geologic period spanning from approximately 358.9 to 298.9 million years ago, characterized by extensive coal-forming swamps and the diversification of terrestrial life.",UNIDADE_CRONO
